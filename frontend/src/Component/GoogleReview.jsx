      text: "Hello All, I recently gone through the gallbladder stone surgery of my wife. I found doctor Pushkar Anand by Google search, and impressed by reading all the reviews and based on that decided to plan a meeting with Dr Pushkar. He took the time to explain the issue in detail, making us understand the long-term complications of keeping stone. His clarity and guidance helped us make an informed decision.On the day of the operation at SRS hospital, where he is a surgeon, Dr. Pushkar Anand ensured we were relax. Post-surgery, he was very supportive and clear my all doubts. Dr. Pushkar Anand is not only an excellent surgeon but also a compassionate doctor who truly cares for his patients. We are extremely grateful for his expertise and highly recommend him to anyone in need of surgical consultation.Entire clinic Staff is very supportive and calm in nature, they always remind patient for each follow-up and also call frequently just to know the well being of patient. Overall a nice experience with a very humble and down to earth Doctor, who always take care of their patients.Thank you so much",

From our very first consultation, he took the time to explain the issue in detail, making us understand the long-term complications of keeping the gallbladder in such a condition. His clarity and guidance helped us make an informed decision.We initially visited him for a second opinion at his clinic, and after discussing the case with him, we felt confident about proceeding with the surgery. On the day of the operation at Apollo Hospital, where he is a surgeon, Dr. Pushkar Anand ensured we were calm and reassured by explaining the entire procedure. Post-surgery, he was extremely supportive, monitoring my wife's recovery and ensuring she was comfortable. Thanks to his care, she was able to return home the very next day.Dr. Pushkar Anand is not only an excellent surgeon but also a compassionate doctor who truly cares for his patients. We are extremely grateful for his expertise and highly recommend him to anyone in need of surgical consultation.",
